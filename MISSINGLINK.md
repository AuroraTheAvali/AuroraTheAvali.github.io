I hear footsteps, I think someone is coming? I hear them shouting my name but my voice keeps escaping me, they'll find me soon, right? I keep hearing a second person and things clanking together, I guess my friends really are coming for me, I hope they can find their way through, I need to make noise somehow, my phone's on 3 but I think I can blast music for a minute, I just hope they notice
